# ITS Irregular Terrain Model (ITM) #

This code repository contains the ITS Irregular Terrain Model (ITM). ITM predicts terrestrial radiowave propagation for frequencies between 20 MHz and 20 GHz based on electromagnetic theory and empirical models developed by Anita Longley and Phil Rice. Propagation mechanisms considered include free space loss, diffraction, and troposcatter. Specifically, ITM predicts attenuation as a function of distance (greater than 1 km), terminal heights, meteorological conditions, terrain effects, and the variability of the signal in time and in space.

**Note**: Version 1.3 of this code base is functionally identical to version 1.2.2 of the FORTRAN source, which has been archived [here](https://github.com/NTIA/itm-longley-rice).  ITS plans to apply all future ITM updates to this C++ code base.

## Quick Start ##

A select set of example inputs and outputs are provided for testing purposes.  This is not a comprehensive validation test set.  For ITM in Point-to-Point Prediction Mode, [p2p.csv](p2p.csv) defines the set of inputs and outputs with [pfls.csv](pfls.csv) containing the corresponding set of terrain profiles.  For Area Prediction Mode, inputs and outputs are defined in [area.csv](area.csv). 

## Inputs ##

ITM can be called in either Area Prediction Mode or Point-to-Point Prediction Mode.  Additionally, variabilities can be defined by either time/location/situation or confidence/reliability.  The below inputs are organized accordingly.

## Error Codes and Warning Flags ##

ITM supports a defined list of error codes and warning flags.  A complete list can be found [here](ERRORS_AND_WARNINGS.md).

## Notes on Code Style ##

* In general, variables follow the naming convention in which a single underscore denotes a subscript (pseudo-LaTeX format), and where a double underscore is followed by the units, i.e. h_tx__meter.
* Variables are named to match their corresponding mathematical variables in the underlying references.
* Wherever possible, equation numbers and source documentation are provided.

## Configure and Build ##

### C++ Software ###

The software is designed to be built into a DLL (or corresponding library for non-Windows systems).  The source code can be built for any OS that supports the standard C++ libraries.  A Visual Studio 2019 project file is provided for Windows users to support the build process and configuration.

### C#/.NET Wrapper Software ###

The .NET support of ITM consists of a simple pass-through wrapper around the native DLL.  It is compiled to target .NET Framework 4.7.2.
